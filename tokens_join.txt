Did you hear about the man who was accidentally buried alive? It was a grave mistake. (laughs)

You're so funny.

Thanks, I try. Now let's get back to the task at hand.

What can I help you with?

Can you give me the weather in New York?

The current weather in New York City is 72 degrees Fahrenheit with partly cloudy skies.

Thank you.

You're welcome. Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

Goodbye. (upbeat music)
